### Notes

- Need to reconsider initial conditions and assumptions in the `constants.py` file. 
- Redshift assumption was made from the ground-based observations of the lens and source.
- The assumption made for $r$ and $\theta$ values for the source position could pose an issue as only a tiny subset of double and quads is being saved.
