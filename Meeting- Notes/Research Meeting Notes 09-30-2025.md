### Notes
1. Contact Amarel Support
2. Try to solve the current Amarel issue via pip installation 
3. Continue to study Neural Network Architecture and the underlying math/mechanics.
4. Try to implement a NN via Keras in python
5. <u>Note to self</u>: "You know how a neural networks works but how do you use one that does work in your favor? Is using a network similar to using a function via the established relationship between input and output?"
6. I have the inputs in my dictionary, need appropriate outputs embedded within my dictionary as well.
	$$
	\left\{x_{i}, \Delta t_i\right\}, z_{l}, z_{s} \rightarrow \left\{\phi_{i}, \alpha_{i}\right\}, D_t 
	$$

7. <u>Note to self 2</u>: Reread the grant proposal.
