### Notes
1. Contact Amarel Support
2. Try to solve the current Amarel issue via pip installation 
3. Continue to study Neural Network Architecture and the underlying math/mechanics.
4. Try to implement a NN via Keras in python
5. Note to self: "You know how a neural networks works but how do you use one that does work in your favor? Is using a network similar to using a function via the established relationship between input and output?"
