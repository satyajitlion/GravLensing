### Notes

- Batch job failed again at 48 hours -->
	- Run the batch job for $10$ mock lenses with deflection and see if it works
	- Rerun the batch job for $10^4$ mock lenses and run 10 versions of this script to extend it to $10^5$ and work towards "dumb parallel processing"
- Think about processing the data before feeding it into the network such that translation or rotation doesn't negatively affect the data and read more about this for how it's done for image data? How does it work in convolutional neural networks? We don't want to use a CNN as we aren't classifying but what is the underlying mechanic
