### Notes

- the problem might be python version for module installation
- maybe I can install a base, local version of python on amarel and setup up everything again including the scientific libraries
- for now, continue working on the neural network aspect of things and try to work towards building a network given the limited amount of data I have
	- The goal here isn't to build an accurate network but to get a framework setup for the neural network such that it is able to run for a much larger dataset (while waiting on the fixes to take effect for Amarel + running the mock lens script)
