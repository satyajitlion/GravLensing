### Today's Focus

Learn how Amarel and the Rutgers Cluster works. Try downloading PuTTy, SCP, and Emacs on laptop. Also, try connecting to a vpn before trying to SSH into Amarel. If I can login and access Amarel, then try to download and transfer files into my home directory. Make a separate sub-directory for GravLensing and transfer files to that folder.

### What I was able to accomplish

I spent a couple hours going back to the Computational Astrophysics modules and relearning the commands needed for Batch Jobs for HPC/HTC. Using this, I was able to take notes on SLURMs and HPC + Amarel as well as the terminal commands. This took me approximately 4-5 hours. Following this, I spent the rest of the time downloading the required software and trying to connect to Amarel. I had some issues in this process and had to find appropriate links for the newer versions of the software. I was able to download Emacs (for text editing), WinSCP, PuTTy, and I also readup on MobaXterm + WSL to check if those pieces of software were necessary. I chose to get PuTTy in the case that WinSCP does not work. My primary issue at the moment is the fact that I cannot download Cisco Anyconnect as Rutgers denies permission for downloading that software.

### Problems

Rutgers doesn't allow me to download its VPN. In order to connect to Amarel, I need a VPN. Need to either be connected to Rutgers network then and need access to the rooms at Serin or gain access to VPN. (Both PuTTy and WinSCP need VPN, i.e Cisco Any Connect).
