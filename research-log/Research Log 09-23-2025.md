### Today's Focus

Learn how Amarel and the Rutgers Cluster works. Try downloading PuTTy, SCP, and Emacs on laptop. Also, try connecting to a vpn before trying to SSH into Amarel. If I can login and access Amarel, then try to download and transfer files into my home directory. Make a separate sub-directory for GravLensing and transfer files to that folder.

### Problems

Rutgers doesn't allow me to download its VPN. In order to connect to Amarel, I need a VPN. Need to either be connected to Rutgers network then and need access to the rooms at Serin or gain access to VPN. Edit: it's either you need to be connected to a VPN OR you need to download PuTTy.
