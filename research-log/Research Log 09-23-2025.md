### Today's Focus

Learn how Amarel and the Rutgers Cluster works. Try downloading PuTTy, SCP, and Emacs on laptop. Also, try connecting to a vpn before trying to SSH into Amarel. If I can login and access Amarel, then try to download and transfer files into my home directory. Make a separate sub-directory for GravLensing and transfer files to that folder.

### What I was able to accomplish

I spent a couple hours going back to the Computational Astrophysics modules and relearning the commands needed for Batch Jobs for HPC/HTC. Using this, I was able to take notes on SLURMs and HPC + Amarel as well as the terminal commands. This took me approximately 5-6 hours. Following this, I spent the rest of the time downloading the required software and trying to connect to Amarel. I had some issues in this process and had to find appropriate links for the newer versions of the software. I was able to download Emacs (for text editing), WinSCP, PuTTy, and I also readup on MobaXterm + WSL to check if those pieces of software were necessary. I chose to get PuTTy in the case that WinSCP does not work. My primary issue at the moment is the fact that I cannot download Cisco Anyconnect as Rutgers denies permission for downloading that software. Additionally, I went through both of the Intro to Amarel videos that demonstrate how one should connect to Amarel and how to download software onto Amarel.

### Results

Today was more so focused on downloading appropriate software and reading up on how to use terminal commands in order to work with Amarel. I was able to compile a list of terminal commands/read up on how to use emacs to more efficiently navigate through the terminal. Additionally, I also went through the OARC documentation on Amarel.

### Problems

Rutgers doesn't allow me to download its VPN. In order to connect to Amarel, I need a VPN. Need to either be connected to Rutgers network then and need access to the rooms at Serin or gain access to VPN. (Both PuTTy and WinSCP need VPN, i.e Cisco Any Connect).

### Questions & Ideas

Will I be able to get access to the Rutgers VPN to connect to Rutgers or would I need an external VPN? Cisco Anyconnect also costs money and is offered for free at Rutgers. Would it be possible to use some other, free version of the VPN to connect to Rutgers and would that work? Additionally, is PuTTy really necessary for connecting to Amarel?

### Next Steps

The next steps are to figure out a way to gain access to a VPN or find an access key to room 330/undergrad lounge on campus so that I can access Amarel directly. I should reconfirm if I still have access to Amarel and try to gain access if I don't have access (ask Dr. Keeton?). Following this, and after connecting to Amarel, I need to install appropriate software on Amarel for the /home directory I should have associated with my NetID. Here, I plan on making a sub-directory for Gravitational Lensing where I will story my two python script files. Then I plan on created a batch job file / SLURM and sending out the job to Amarel. After this, in the meantime, I plan on waiting for the job from Amarel to finish, and extracting the output files to my local workstation. Following this, I should be ready to move on to the next phase of the research.
