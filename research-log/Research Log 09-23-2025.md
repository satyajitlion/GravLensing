  
### Today's Focus

Learn how Amarel and the Rutgers Cluster works. Try downloading PuTTy, SCP, and Emacs on laptop. Also, try connecting to a vpn before trying to SSH into Amarel. If I can login and access Amarel, then try to download and transfer files into my home directory. Make a separate sub-directory for GravLensing and transfer files to that folder.
