### Today's Focus

Today's work centered on advancing the Gravitational Lens neural network research project. The primary objectives were to analyze the results from three distinct lensing simulations (Shear Only, Ellip Only, and Both), classify the generated mock lenses, and begin constructing the neural network infrastructure for future data analysis. A key success was confirming the successful generation of mock lenses with the incorporated potential on the Amarel computing cluster.
