### Today's Focus

Ensure the successful execution of the 100k-element mock lens generation batch job on the Amarel cluster while concurrently building foundational expertise in Keras to prepare for the machine learning phase of the project. This involves actively monitoring the job's status and resource consumption via SLURM commands and real-time log inspection, while systematically studying Keras from environment setup and core syntax to model architecture design principles and the end-to-end workflow for building and training neural networks.
