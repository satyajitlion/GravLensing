### Today's Focus

My primary focus was on advancing the project through a discussion with my professor and strengthening my mathematical foundation. The meeting aimed to clarify concepts related to the time delay surface in gravitational lensing and to plan the next steps for implementing a neural network. Following that, I dedicated time to studying group theory to better understand the principles underlying Group Equivariant Convolutional Neural Networks.

### What I was able to accomplish

1. Held a meeting to discuss the project's direction, focusing on the physical interpretation of time delays and data preparation for neural networks.
    
2. Dedicated time to studying fundamental group theory, including definitions, properties, and proofs of key lemmas, to build a stronger mathematical foundation for GCNNs.
    
3. Identified concrete next steps for the data processing pipeline and model exploration.
