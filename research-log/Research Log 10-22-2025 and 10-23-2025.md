### The Focus for These Two Days

The primary focus was on advancing the theoretical and computational foundations of the project. This involved:

1. Continuing the study of Group Theory and its application to Group Equivariant Neural Networks.
    
2. Creating the Python script to combine the output arrays from the Amarel batch jobs for analysis.
    
3. Integrating Dr. Keeton's guidance on calculating the lensing potential at image positions into the `Analysis.ipynb` notebook.
