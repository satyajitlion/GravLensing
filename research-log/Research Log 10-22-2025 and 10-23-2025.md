### The Focus for These Two Days

The primary focus was on advancing the theoretical and computational foundations of the project. This involved:

1. Continuing the study of Group Theory and its application to Group Equivariant Neural Networks.
    
2. Creating the Python script to combine the output arrays from the Amarel batch jobs for analysis.
    
3. Integrating Dr. Keeton's guidance on calculating the lensing potential at image positions into the `Analysis.ipynb` notebook.

### What I was able to accomplish

- **Group Theory Study:** Watched instructional videos on Group Theory and completed a detailed proof of Lemma 1.2.2 to solidify understanding of fundamental group properties (uniqueness of identity and inverse elements). This took me quite a bit of time as it has been quite some time since I had taken real analysis or a rigorous math course. Therefore, the mathematical language was a bit tough to immediately understand. There were also small nuances within the Proof for the lemma so I definitely needed time to explore.
    
- **Script Completion:** Successfully wrote and tested the `combine_arrays.py` script. This script efficiently loads, concatenates, and saves the split `valShear`, `valEllip`, and `valBoth` arrays from the `AmarelOutput` directory into a new `CombinedArrays` folder.
    
- **Analysis Implementation:** Implemented Dr. Keeton's Slack recommendation into the `Analysis.ipynb` notebook. Added the code to compute the lensing potential, deflection vectors, and magnification tensors at the solved image positions using `plane.defmag(imgarr)`.
