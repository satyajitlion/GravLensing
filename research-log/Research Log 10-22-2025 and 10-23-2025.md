### The Focus for These Two Days

The primary focus was on advancing the theoretical and computational foundations of the project. This involved:

1. Continuing the study of Group Theory and its application to Group Equivariant Neural Networks.
    
2. Creating the Python script to combine the output arrays from the Amarel batch jobs for analysis.
    
3. Integrating Dr. Keeton's guidance on calculating the lensing potential at image positions into the `Analysis.ipynb` notebook.

### What I was able to accomplish

- **Group Theory Study:** Watched instructional videos on Group Theory and completed a detailed proof of Lemma 1.2.2 to solidify understanding of fundamental group properties (uniqueness of identity and inverse elements).
    
- **Script Completion:** Successfully wrote and tested the `combine_arrays.py` script. This script efficiently loads, concatenates, and saves the split `valShear`, `valEllip`, and `valBoth` arrays from the `AmarelOutput` directory into a new `CombinedArrays` folder.
    
- **Analysis Implementation:** Promptly implemented the professor's Slack recommendation into the `Analysis.ipynb` notebook. Added the code to compute the lensing potential, deflection vectors, and magnification tensors at the solved image positions using `plane.defmag(imgarr)`.
