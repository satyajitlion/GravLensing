### The Focus for These Two Days

The primary focus was on advancing the theoretical and computational foundations of the project. This involved:

1. **Deepening Theoretical Knowledge:** Continuing the study of Group Theory and its application to Group Equivariant Neural Networks.
    
2. **Developing Data Pipeline:** Finalizing the Python script to combine the output arrays from the Amarel batch jobs for downstream analysis.
    
3. **Implementing Analysis Tools:** Integrating the professor's guidance on calculating the lensing potential at image positions into the `Analysis.ipynb` notebook.
