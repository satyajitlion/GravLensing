### Today's Focus

Get access to room 330 and try to log into Amarel using the Bash terminal. If able to login, create a sub-directory named "GravLensing". Copy current python scripts, ```pygravlens.py```, ```constants.py```, and ```generateMockLens.py``` into the subdirectory using WinSCP. Schedule the batch job via SLURM and figure out how creating jobs works in Amarel.
