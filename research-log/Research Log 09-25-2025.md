### Today's Focus

Get access to room 330 and try to log into Amarel using the Bash terminal. If able to login, create a sub-directory named "GravLensing". Copy current python scripts, ```pygravlens.py```, ```constants.py```, and ```generateMockLens.py``` into the subdirectory using WinSCP. Schedule the batch job via SLURM and figure out how creating jobs works in Amarel.

### What I was able to accomplish

I was able to get into room 330 and access Amarel. I logged into Amarel via ssh and my Git Bash terminal. Following this, I copied the necessary files and changed the ```num_mock``` parameter to $10^5$. I then went back to my computational astrophysics and the OARC resources for how to create SLURM files and how scheduling batch jobs works with Amarel. This entire process took me hours of work as I kept stumbling into errors when creating the SLURM files. Most of the errors pertained to installing external packages improperly or mishandling certain commands.
