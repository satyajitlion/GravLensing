### The Focus for these Two Days

Exploring neural network architectures that maintain performance under translational and rotational transformations of gravitational lensing data. Investigating the mathematical foundations of group theory and its application to equivariant and invariant neural networks for astrophysical data analysis.

### What I was able to accomplish

- Successfully set up and launched 10 parallel batch jobs on Amarel for mock lens generation
    
- Studied fundamental concepts of group theory and symmetry operations
    
- Learned about the mathematical distinctions between equivariance
