### Today's Focus

Continue neural network regularization research. Improve understanding of dropout and early stopping techniques, explore their practical implementations in Keras, and begin designing neural network architectures suitable for the mock lens data being generated. Bridge theoretical knowledge with practical application by considering how to handle geometric transformations in gravitational lens data.

### What I was able to accomplish

- Studyied dropout and early stopping techniques in depth to further deepen my understanding of regularization

- **Developed intuitive understanding of dropout** through real-world analogies and visual representations 

- **Documented practical code examples** for implementing both regularization techniques

- Learned about the **Early stopping implementation in Keras** with proper validation monitoring and patience parameters
