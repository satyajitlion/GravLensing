### Today's Focus

Bridging the gap between the theoretical concepts of group theory and their practical implementation in neural networks. The primary goal was to understand the mathematical formulation of Group Convolutional Neural Networks (G-CNNs) and how they generalize the operation of standard CNNs to achieve equivariance beyond just translation.
