### Group Theory

- A group is mathematically defined as a set equipped with a binary operator.
	- A set here is just a collection of functions (i.e different Translations or Rotations)
	- The Group operation operates on elements of this set and this operator tells us how to compose elements of this set.
		- output of this operation must be a **member of the Group**.

```math
\text{Group} \rightarrow (G, \cdot) 
```
```math
\Rightarrow G \times G \rightarrow G
```
