### Group Theory

- A group is mathematically defined as a set equipped with a binary operator.
	- A set here is just a collection of functions (i.e different Translations or Rotations)
	- The Group operation operates on elements of this set and this operator tells us how to compose elements of this set.
		- output of this operation must be a **member of the Group**.
	- A group action refers to the group acting on some space, i.e space of pixels.
		- Rotate or transform pixels with the elements in the Group.

```math
\text{Group} \rightarrow (G, \cdot) 
```
```math
\Rightarrow G \times G \rightarrow G
```

Note:
A group needs to fulfill all of the following 4 properties to be considered as a group.
1. Closure - Output never "leaves" the group
2. Associativity - Operation assigned to group is associative
3. Identity - Group contains an identity element which keeps all elements inside the group
4. Inverse - An inverse element exists inside of a group that maps to the identity.
