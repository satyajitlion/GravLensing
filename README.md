# Application of Machine Learning in Gravitational Lens Modeling

A pipeline for generating mock gravitational lens data and training neural networks to constrain the Hubble Constant ($H_0$).

## Project Overview

This project develops a machine learning approach to gravitational lens modeling, with the ultimate goal of determining the Hubble Constant. The workflow consists of three main phases:

1. **Mock Lens Generation**: Create realistic training data using gravitational lensing physics
2. **Neural Network Training**: Train models to predict lens parameters from observable features
3. **Hubble Constant Estimation**: Apply trained models to real lens systems to constrain H₀

## Scientific Motivation

Gravitational lens time delays provide one of the most direct methods for measuring $H_0$, but traditional modeling approaches are computationally inefficient. This project explores machine learning as a faster, more scalable alternative for extracting cosmological parameters from lensed systems.

## Project Pipeline

### Phase 1: Data Generation (Current)
- **Input**: Cosmological parameters, lens/source redshifts, mass distributions
- **Process**: Physical lens modeling using `pygravlens.py`
- **Output**: Mock lens systems with known parameters (→ training data)

### Phase 2: Machine Learning Training (Future)
- **Input**: Mock lens data (image positions, magnifications, time delays)
- **Process**: Neural network training to learn parameter → observables mapping
- **Output**: Trained models that can predict parameters from observables

### Phase 3: Hubble Constant Application (Future)
- **Input**: Real lens systems (e.g., from H0LiCOW, TDCOSMO)
- **Process**: Apply trained ML models to infer $H_0$
- **Output**: Hubble Constant constraints with uncertainty estimates
